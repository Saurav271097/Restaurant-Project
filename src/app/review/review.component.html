                    We found the restaurant by accident and we were just blown away.. the very friendly and attentive wait staff.... the perfectly balanced salads and great quality main courses were wonderful.The cocktails were perfectly mixed - not too sweet, not too sour, and very tasty. We really appreciated the personal touches of the restaurant manager who made sure that the seats were reserved and checked back regularly to ensure everything was ok. We'll definitely be back - we loved it!

                    We visited this beautiful restaurant only due to some positive reviews on TripAdvisor.
We had Kale Salad, Veg Cheese Quesadilla, Miso Seabaas and Risotto with few glasses of Mateus Rose wine. The food and wine wine was amazing.
It had a family ambience and very courteous service.
Worth trying...

                    Totally unexpected but the food has hit my sensibilities so much that even after a month it still stays there!!! Nothing has compared to it ever!! And Iâ€™m not even a foodie!!!!
